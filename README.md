# Dog breeds recognition
Application for recognition of dog breeds using artificial intelligence and deep learning, which downloads photos of dogs of selected breeds from the Internet, 
shown in various moments of movement (walking, running, standing) and creates a folder with the corresponding name for each breed. The downloaded photos are a set for training the algorithm.

An example for which the breed will be determined is a randomly downloaded photo of a dog (dog.jpg). The output of the program is a graph showing the percentage of belonging to each of the  selected breeds
(we can also assume that belonging to several breeds is the result of mixed breed).
